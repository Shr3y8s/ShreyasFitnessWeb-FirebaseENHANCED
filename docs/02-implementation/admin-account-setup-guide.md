# Admin Account Setup Guide

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** Complete  
**Purpose:** Instructions for creating your admin account manually in Firebase

---

## 🎯 Overview

Your fitness platform now uses a **two-collection architecture** where admin accounts are stored separately from client accounts. This guide will walk you through creating your admin account **one time** in Firebase Console.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Two-Collection Structure:**

```
Firestore:
├─ admins/              ← Your admin account (protected)
│  └─ {yourUID}/
│     ├─ name: "Your Name"
│     ├─ email: "your@email.com"
│     ├─ role: "admin"
│     └─ paymentStatus: "n/a"
│
└─ users/               ← Client accounts (can delete during testing)
   ├─ client1/
   ├─ client2/
   └─ client3/
```

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Admin account is separate and protected
- ✅ Can delete entire `users` collection during testing
- ✅ Your admin account never gets accidentally deleted
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

## 📋 One-Time Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Create Account in Firebase Authentication**

### **Test Your Admin Account:**

1. **Go to Your App:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/login
   ```

2. **Login with Your Credentials:**
   ```
   Email: your@email.com
   Password: YourSecurePassword123!
   ```

3. **Verify Redirect:**
   - Should redirect to: `/dashboard/trainer`
   - You should see the trainer dashboard
   - Sidebar should show all trainer features

4. **Check Account Settings:**
   - Click **"Account Settings"** in sidebar footer
   - Should see:
     - ✅ Your name
     - ✅ Your email
     - ✅ Role: admin
     - ✅ Can update profile
     - ✅ Can change email/password

---

## 🔒 Security Features

### **What's Protected:**

✅ **Admin collection is read-only**
- Only you can read your own admin document
- No one can write to admins collection (manually managed only)

✅ **Auth logic checks both collections**
- Checks `admins/` first
- Falls back to `users/` for clients
- Proper role-based routing

✅ **Account settings works for both**
- Detects which collection you're in
- Updates the correct collection
- Email/password changes work properly

---

## 🧪 Testing During Development

### **Safe Testing Workflow:**

1. **Create Test Clients:**
   - Use regular signup flow at `/signup`
   - These go into `users/` collection

2. **Test Features:**
   - Test client signup
   - Test payment flow
   - Test dashboard features

3. **Clean Up:**
   - Go to Firestore Console
   - Delete entire `users/` collection
   - Your admin account in `admins/` is unaffected!

4. **Repeat:**
   - Create new test clients
   - Test again
   - Delete again
   - Admin always safe!

---

## 📝 Daily Usage

### **Your Workflow:**

```
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/login
2. Login with your admin credentials
3. Use trainer dashboard
4. That's it!
```

### **No More:**
- ❌ Admin signup page
- ❌ Password in browser
- ❌ Manual Firestore edits (after initial setup)
- ❌ Worrying about deleting your account

---

## 🔄 Future: Adding More Trainers

If you ever need to add more trainers in the future:

### **Option 1: Manual (Current Approach)**
- Repeat this setup process
- Create in Authentication
- Create in `users/` collection (with role: "trainer")

### **Option 2: Build Admin UI (Future Enhancement)**
- Create admin-only page at `/admin/trainers`
- Must be logged in as admin
- UI to create trainer accounts
- Proper authentication-based security

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Can't login after creating account**

**Solution:**
1. Verify UID matches in both places:
   - Firebase Auth UID
   - Firestore document ID
2. Check Firestore document has `role: "admin"`
3. Check email matches exactly

---

### **Problem: Redirected to client dashboard instead of trainer**

**Solution:**
1. Check Firestore document:
   - Should be in `admins/` collection
   - Field `role` should be "admin" or "trainer"
2. If in wrong collection, delete and recreate

---

### **Problem: Account settings not saving**

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firestore rules are deployed:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```
3. Check you're logged in

---

## 📊 What Changed

### **Before (Insecure):**
```
❌ Admin signup page with password in browser
❌ Password visible in DevTools
❌ URL easy to guess (/admin/signup)
❌ Anyone could create trainers
❌ One collection for everyone
```

### **After (Secure):**
```
✅ Manual admin creation (one time)
✅ No password in browser
✅ No admin signup page needed

✅ Separate collections (admins vs users)
✅ Safe testing (delete users, keep admin)
```
